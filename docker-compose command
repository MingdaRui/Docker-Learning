Version 2:
Compose files using the verison 2 syntax must indicate the version number at the root of the document.
All services must be declared under the services Key.

version 2 files are supported by Compose 1.6.0+ and require a Docker Engine of version 1.10.0+


ports:
Expose ports. Either specify both ports (HOST:CONTAINER), or just the container port (a random host port will be chosen)

Note: When mapping ports in the HOST:CONTAINER format, you may experience erroneous results when using a container port
lower than 60, because YAML will parse numbers in the format xx:yy as sexagesimal (base 60). FOr this reason, we recommend
always explicitly speifying your port mappings as strings.
